-----Tumor invasion-metastatic cascade model-----
-------------------------------------------------

   our MATLAB model studies the growth of tumors from
the beginning by assuming that there is a random number
of tumor cells in a primary site, until it starts to
spread to other secondary sites, and invades these sites
with the same algorithim as the primary, and we distinguished
our tumor cells into 2 different types, mesenchymal and epithelial.

this model has multiple stages and they are as follows:
   1. invasion 
   2. intravasation
   3. travel through vessel
   4. extravasation
   5. invasion in secondary sites

first the invasion:

   it is the spread and movement of tumor cells in the primary
site and it continues to spread under the PDE equation
       ∂𝑐k/∂t= 𝐷k.∇^2.𝑐k  − ∅k.∇ . (𝑐k.∇.𝜔)
where K could stand for epithelial or mesenchymal cells.
   we also included some factors to our model like the MDE
and ECM that we refered to as m and w respectively,
and the followed the PDE equation:
       ∂m/∂t = 𝐷𝑚.∇^2.𝑚 + Θ.𝑐𝑀 − Λ.m
and
       𝜕𝜔/𝜕𝑡 = −(Γ1.𝑐𝑀 + Γ2.𝑚).w

then there is the intravasation stage:

   after the tumor touches a vasculature its cells can enter
the blood stream to start spreading to other body parts
the process of entering is what known as inravasation.

then we start the travelling through blood stage:

   the tumor cells that entered the blood stream keeps moving
for a period of time, during this period the tumor cells
faces the possibility of surviving or dying if it survives
we move to the next stage.

the next stage is extravasation:

   after the tumor cells finishes its period in the blood,
the model then decides which secondary site in the body will
the cells exit to based on different probabilities.

after exiting we move to invasion again:

   the cells that traveled to this secondary site then starts to
spread and invade just like in the primary site with the same
equation but it cannot intravasate from this secondary site
to the vasculature.
